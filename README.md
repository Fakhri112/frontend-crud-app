*Simple CRUD APP with JWT Authentication. It also responsive*

## Technology Used
- ReactJS
- React Top Loading Bar
- React Cookie
- React Router
- Axios (Send and fetch data between client and server)
- Bootstrap 5
- JWT Decode (Decode data from JWT Access Token API Server)


## Usage

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

To send and fetch data through API, you will need my [CRUD App - Backend](https://github.com/Fakhri112/backend-crud-app) project

## Note
After successfully login, the access token will be stored in Client-Side Cookie (not HTTP-Only Cookie). But dont worry the access token will automatically generate new one after 15 second.
